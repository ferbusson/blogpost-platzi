This is me again, I am 39 years old and I am super cool

I came back to an old version of historia.txt with checkout <commit number> historia.txt, now I am adding this text, then I ll do git add . to stage the new changes and I ll commit this file with the new text. This is how I can move between file versions and get what I need. After the commit I ll keep what you are reading right now July 22 2022
